What drives ideological division about political problems? When
prioritising which problems are most in need of redress, voters might
disagree about the severity of individual outcomes that constitute such
problems; the prevalence of those problems; or whether such problems are
amenable to solution by government action. We field a large survey
experiment in the UK and US and develop a new measurement approach which
allows us to evaluate how ideological disagreements change when
respondents consider the individual badness, social severity, and
priority for government action of a set of 41 political problems. We
find that large ideological divergences are observed in beliefs about
social severity and priority for government action, not individual
problem badness, and only in the US. An important implication of these
results is that polarization over problem-prioritization is more likely
to be an emergent property of US politics than of the psychology of US
citizens.

<p><strong>Liberals and Conservatives Rely on Very Similar Sets of

<div id="foo_chickens" class="jumbotron" visibility="none">
Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) aims to explain the origins of and
variation in human moral reasoning. Applications in political science
have revealed differences in the degree to which liberals and
conservatives explicitly endorse five core moral foundations of care,
fairness, authority, loyalty and sanctity. However, differences in
self-reported assessments of the moral relevance of each foundation do
not imply that citizens with different political orientations respond to
concrete scenarios based on different moral intuitions. We introduce a
new approach for measuring the implicit importance of the 5 moral
foundations by asking survey respondents from the UK and the US to
compare pairs of vignettes which describe violations relevant to each
foundation. We analyse responses to these comparisons using a
hierarchical Bradley-Terry model which allows us to evaluate the
relative importance of each foundation to individuals with different
political perspectives. Our results suggest that, despite prominent
claims to the contrary, voters on the left and the right of politics
share broadly similar moral intuitions.

<p><strong>Testing Negative: The Non-Consequences of COVID-19 on Mass

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic governments implemented large-scale
economic and social policies that, outside of war time, are
unprecedented in scale and scope. They highlighted the state’s capacity
to guarantee economic and health security, and they reached beyond
demographic groups that are more typically beneficiaries of state
support. Because of this, we hypothesise that exposure to the pandemic
and these policy responses caused ideological change, including
attitudes to the role of government in the economy, redistribution, and
the deservingness of beneficiaries of state support. We test this
expectation using data from the long-running (2014–present) British
Election Study Internet Panel, together with a unique panel survey
fielded to existing BES respondents in April and September, 2020. Our
panel makes it possible to track individuals on a rich set of variables
both before and during the pandemic. We find virtually no evidence that
the pandemic, or exposure to pandemic-induced shocks, affected
ideological beliefs about the role of government, or economic and social
policy attitudes. In a follow-up survey experiment on British
respondents we test one possible reason for this lack of change –- a
lack of elite cues -– but find that exposure to elite cues linking the
pandemic to a greater government role in providing welfare, national
insurance and public spending has no impact on ideological beliefs
either. We conclude that the pandemic was not, and could not have been,
a cause of mass ideological change.

<p><strong>Using automated text classification to explore uncertainty in
NICE appraisals for drugs for rare diseases</strong>

<p><em>Accepted, International Journal of Technology Assessment in

<div id="foo_covid_risk" class="jumbotron" visibility="none">
This study examined the application, feasibility and validity of
supervised learning models for text classification in appraisals for
rare disease treatments (RDTs) in relation to uncertainty, and analyzed
differences between appraisals based on the classification results. We
analyzed appraisals for RDTs (n = 94) published by the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) between 01/2011 and
05/2023. We used Naïve Bayes, Lasso, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
models in a binary text classification task (classifying paragraphs as
either referencing uncertainty in the evidence base or not). To
illustrate the results of the classification task, we tested hypotheses
about differences between RDT appraisals in relation to the appraisal
guidance (technology appraisal (TA) or highly specialized technology
(HST) appraisal guidance), advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP)
status, disease area, and age group. The best performing (Lasso) model
achieved 83.6 percent classification accuracy (sensitivity = 74.4
percent, specificity = 92.6 percent). Paragraphs classified as
referencing uncertainty were significantly more likely to arise in HST
appraisals compared to TA appraisals (AOR=1.44, 95% CI 1.09, 1.90,
p=0.004). There was no significant association between paragraphs
classified as referencing uncertainty and appraisals for ATMPs,
non-oncology RDTs, and RDTs indicated for children only or adults and
children. These results were robust to the threshold value used for
classifying paragraphs but were sensitive to the choice of
classification model. Using supervised learning models for text
classification in NICE appraisals for RDTs is feasible but the results
of downstream analyses may be sensitive to the choice of classification
model.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a large shock to the risk
of acquiring a disease that represents a meaningful threat to health. We
investigate whether individuals subject to larger increases in objective
health risk – operationalised by occupation-based measures of proximity
to other people – became more supportive of increased government
healthcare spending during the crisis. Using panel data which tracks UK
individuals before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, we implement
a fixed-effect design which was pre-registered before the key treatment
variable was available to us. While individuals in high-risk occupations
were more worried about their personal risk of infection, and had higher
COVID death rates, there is no evidence that increased health risks
during COVID-19 shifted attitudes on government spending on healthcare,
nor broader attitudes relating to redistribution. Our findings are
consistent with recent research demonstrating the limited effects of the
pandemic on political attitudes.

<p><strong>No Longer Conforming to Stereotypes? Gender, Political Style,

Research on political style suggests that where women make arguments
that are more emotional, empathetic, and positive, men use language that
is more analytical, aggressive, and complex. However, existing work does
not consider how gendered patterns of style vary over time. Focusing on
the UK, we argue that pressures for female politicians to conform to
stereotypically ‘feminine’ styles have diminished in recent years. To
test this argument, we describe novel quantitative text analysis
approaches for measuring a diverse set of styles at scale in political
speech data. Analysing UK parliamentary debates between 1997 and 2019,
we show that female MPs’ debating styles have changed substantially over
time, as women in parliament have increasingly adopted stylistic traits
that are typically associated with ‘masculine’ stereotypes of
communication. Our findings imply that prominent gender-based
stereotypes of politicians’ behaviour are significantly worse
descriptors of empirical reality now than they were in the past.

Which types of political rhetoric are most persuasive? Politicians make
arguments that share common rhetorical elements, including metaphor, ad
hominem attacks, appeals to expertise, moral appeals, and many others.
However, political arguments are also highly multidimensional, making it
difficult to assess the relative persuasive power of these elements. We
report on a novel experimental design which assesses the relative per-
suasiveness of a large number of arguments that deploy a set of
rhetorical elements to argue for and against proposals across a range of
UK political issues. We find modest dif- ferences in the average
effectiveness of rhetorical elements shared by many arguments, but also
large variation in the persuasiveness of arguments of the same
rhetorical type across issues. In addition to revealing that some
argument-types are more effective than others in shaping public opinion,
these results have important implications for the interpretation of
survey-experimental studies in the field of political communication.

It is difficult to measure public views on tradeoffs between spending
priorities because public understanding of existing government spending
is limited and the budgetary problem is complicated. We present a new
measurement strategy using UK taxpayer summaries as the baseline for a
continuous treatment, multivariate choice experiment. The experiment
proposes deficit neutral bundles of changes in spending and taxation,
allowing us to investigate attitudes towards modifications to the
existing budget. We then use a structural choice model to estimate
public preferences over 13 spending categories and the taxation level,
on average and as a function of respondent attributes. We find that the
UK public favours paying more in tax to finance large spending increases
across major budget categories; that spending preferences are
multidimensional; and that younger people prefer lower levels of
taxation and spending than older people. Finally, we report a
pre-registered out-of-sample validation of the estimates from the
experiment.

<div id="petition_toggle" class="jumbotron" visibility="none">
By making it easier for citizens to communicate their preferences,
online forms of political participation have the potential to strengthen
the representational link between politicians and voters. However, we
know little about the effects of online advocacy on politicians’
behaviour. Using new data from an e-petition system in the UK, I show
that support for a petition amongst a Member of Parliament’s
constituents substantially increases the probability that the MP
advocates for the petition in parliamentary debate, even when compared
to their behaviour in counterfactual non-petition debates which focus on
the same policy issues. However, MP responsiveness is conditioned both
by party discipline and electoral competition. These findings have
important implications for our understanding of dyadic representation in
parliamentary systems.

We describe the institutional setting of parliamentary debate in the UK
House of Commons and assess the determinants of participation in
Commons’ debates using data on more than two million speeches from 1979
to 2019. We show that the main determinant of participation in
parliamentary debate in the UK is whether an MP holds an institutionally
powerful position in either the government or opposition parties. In
addition, we describe two patterns in the evolution of debate behaviour
in the Commons over time. First, although MPs in government and
opposition leadership positions give more speeches than backbench MPs in
all periods that we study, the speech-making “bonus” these actors enjoy
has decreased over time. Second, MPs have increasingly employed
constituency-oriented language in their parliamentary speeches over the
past 40 years; a finding we link to theoretical accounts of legislative
competition in personal-vote-seeking electoral systems.

Do female leaders amplify the voices of other women in politics? I
address this question by examining parliamentary debates in the UK House
of Commons. In the context of a difference-in-differences design which
makes use of over-time variation in the gender of cabinet ministers, I
demonstrate that female ministers substantially increase the
participation of other female MPs in relevant debates, compared to when
the minister is male. Further, using a measure of debate influence based
on the degree to which words used by one legislator are adopted by other
members, I show that female ministers also increase the influence of
female backbenchers. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, I
introduce a new metric of ministerial responsiveness and show that
female ministers are significantly more responsive to the speeches of
female backbenchers than are male ministers.

When exogenous shocks make status quo policies less attractive,
legislators become more tolerant to proposed alternatives that are
further from their ideal in general political dimensions. This increases
the discretion of legislative agenda-setters, and allows them to pass
policy that would have been impossible in the absence of a crisis. We
argue that this dynamic explains changes in voting patterns of the
European Parliament during the period of the financial crisis, given
control of the agenda-setting process by pro-integration actors. We
observe voting coalitions increasingly dividing legislators along the
pro-anti integration dimension of disagreement, but only in policy areas
related to the crisis. In line with more qualitative assessments of the
content of passed legislation, the implication is that pro-integration
actors were able to shift policy further towards integration than they
could have without the crisis.

Which parties benefit from open-list (as opposed to closed-list)
proportional representation elections? This article shows that a move
from closed-list to open-list competition is likely to be more favorable
to parties with more internal disagreement on salient issues; this is
because voters who might have voted for a unified party under closed
lists may be drawn to specific candidates within internally divided
parties under open lists. The study provides experimental evidence of
this phenomenon in a hypothetical European Parliament election in the
UK, in which using an open-list ballot would shift support from UKIP
(the Eurosceptic party) to Eurosceptic candidates of the Conservative
Party. The findings suggest that open-list ballots could restrict
support for parties that primarily mobilize on a single issue.

<p><strong>Does Reason-Giving Affect Political Attitudes?</strong>

<div id="foo_reasons" class="jumbotron" visibility="none">
What are the effects of reason-giving on political attitudes? Both
political philosophers and political scientists have speculated that
defending proposals with reasons may change voters’ preferences.
However, while models of attitude formation predict that the explicit
justification of one’s political views may result in attitudes that are
more ideologically consistent, less polarized, and more stable,
empirical work has not assessed the connection between reason-giving and
attitudes. Implementing a survey experiment in which some respondents
provide reasons before stating their opinions on six issues in UK
politics, I find that reason-giving has very limited effects on the
constraint, stability, or polarization of the public’s political
attitudes. These findings have important implications for our
understanding of deliberative conceptions of democracy – in which
reason-giving is a central component – as well as for our understanding
of the quality of voters’ political opinions.

<p><strong>Citizens’ Preferences for Multidimensional
Representation</strong>

<div id="foo_multirep" class="jumbotron" visibility="none">
How do citizens want to be represented in politics? We investigate
citizens’ <em>multidimensional</em> preferences regarding six
conceptions of representation that figure prominently in political
theory but of which some have been overlooked in empirical work. Using
original item batteries and a conjoint experiment, we elicit the
relative importance of the dimensions and the types of representation
people prefer on each. Our results from surveys fielded in the USA, the
UK, and Germany show that (1) descriptive representation has limited
appeal for citizens at large, but is important for historically
marginalized groups; (2) citizens do not focus on local politicians when
thinking about who represents them, but also seek representation from
co-partisan politicians in other districts; (3) while citizens strongly
value substantive representation, they are largely indifferent as to
whether their representatives are responsive to electoral sanctions. Our
findings have important implications for how political scientists study
democratic representation.

_Working Paper (2018)_

<div id="foo7" class="jumbotron" visibility = "none">
Assessing which actors are influential in political debate is important for understanding the mechanisms behind legislative decision-making. Conceiving of 'influence' as a speaker's ability to mould discussion of an issue towards their own framing, I propose a measurement strategy which infers influence by modelling each speech in a debate as a function of the speeches that preceded it. Intuitively, an influential speech is one that is highly predictive of other speeches that occur later in the debate, and influential legislators are those who deliver influential speeches. I apply this method to debates in the UK House of Commons from 1979 to 2018, and compare the measure to potential alternatives in a series of validation tests. I demonstrate the value of this approach by using the measure to address important questions in legislative politics.

_Working Paper (2016)_

<div id="foo6" class="jumbotron" visibility = "none">Where the preferences of party members are more diffuse, it becomes more difficult for legislative party leaders to discipline their members, making agenda control a more attractive means of maintaining party cohesion on the legislative floor. Thus, when disciplinary resources are limited, increases in intra-party polarisation will increase the range of proposals blocked by party leaders. Using roll-call data and a new dataset of blocked legislative proposals, I show that these relationships hold in the European Parliament, where agenda control and carrot and stick disciplinary powers are held by different sets of parliamentary actors. These findings have implications for our understanding of European Parliament politics specifically, and for the relationship between intra-party dynamics and legislative gridlock more generally.</div></div>
