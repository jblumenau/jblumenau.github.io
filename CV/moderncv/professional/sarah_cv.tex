I worked with staff and students, developing skills, as well as awareness of the importance of voice and communication to personal, social, educational and career growth.  The role was highly varied, training staff across all departments and levels, as well as short and long term projects with the students.

I regularly coached students and teachers from other schools affiliated with Mulberry.}

\item \textbf{Leading Women into Headship Summit} -- The summit brought together aspiring headteachers and policymakers to consider ways to address the gender imbalance in headship in schools. The Summit was organised by an alliance of leadership and academic organisations (ASCL, The Future Leaders Trust, UCL IOE and #WomenEd). I facilitated sessions focusing on developing authenticity and confidence in communication in order to improve an executive leadership voice. \\
\item \textbf{Fetch Me A Pen Project, London Schools Excellence Fund} -- This project worked to provide students with a strong set of communication skills with the goal of contributing to the quality of their academic writing, and thereby their long-term academic outcomes. I trained a group of teachers in voice and communication skills in order to enable them to deliver a formal programme to students, as well as helping them to model good vocal practice and communication throughout all of their pedagogical activities.\\\\
\item \textbf{Springboard Project, Oxford Learning Institute, University of Oxford} -- This is an award-winning personal and professional development programme, created specifically to enable women to achieve their full potential both at work and in their personal lives.
